<p>The Punjab government on Tuesday declared all 23 districts of the state flood-hit, as heavy rainfall and swollen rivers continued to wreak havoc, leaving 30 people dead so far, and affecting more than 3.5 lakh residents.</p>
<p>According to official figures, Pathankot recorded the highest number of fatalities at six, followed by Ludhiana with four. Three people remain missing in Pathankot.</p>
<p>This is much below the figures for the 1988 floods, which saw at least 600 deaths, but the spread is as wide; and people refer often and with trepidation to the nightmare of 37 years ago.</p>
<p>The floods have also caused extensive damage to agriculture, with 1,48,590 hectares of crops submerged. Gurdaspur remains the worst-affected district in Punjab, where 324 villages have been hit. Amritsar reported damage in 135 villages and Hoshiarpur in 119 villages.</p>

<p>Mumbai – Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail (MAHSR Bullet Train) project is a 508.17 km under construction High Speed Rail line that will connect Mumbai, Maharashtra with Ahmedabad, Gujarat through 12 stations at an estimated cost of Rs. 1.1 lakh crore (US$15 billion).</p>
<p>The project is being executed by the National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd. (NHSRCL) through a 50-year ₹88,087 crore (US$12 billion) loan from Japan at an interest rate of 0.1%, with repayments scheduled to start 15 years after the line becomes operational.</p>
<p>The first section of Mumbai – Ahmedabad Bullet Train project in Gujarat is expected to open in 2028.

Current Project Deadline: December 2026
My Estimated Completion: 2030
Trains on the line will operate at a speed of 320 kmph on an elevated viaduct 10-15m above the ground except in Mumbai where the line will be built underground using 3 mega Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM). Between Mumbai and Thane stations, the line will run under the sea at Thane Creek for roughly 2 km.</p>
<p>The project’s foundation stone was laid by the prime ministers of India and Japan on September 14, 2017 after which construction work commenced for a 4000-employee High-Speed Rail Training Institute (HSRTI) in Vadodara. The Indian government had originally set a deadline of August 15, 2022, but that was not able to be met due to tendering delays and land acquisition hurdles.</p>
