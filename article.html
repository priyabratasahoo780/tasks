    <h1> <q>The History of Computers and the Internet</q></h1>
    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b>
such as the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the 
<u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept 
of a programmable computer</strong>.
</p><br>
<h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has 
evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.
The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, 
while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.
By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal 
and affordable</em>.
<h2>Mathematics in Computing</h2>
<p>A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup></p>
<h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by
Tim Berners-Lee. As he once said:
<blockquote>
   "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
   Access by everyone regardless of disability is 
   an essential aspect." 
   â€“ <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
</blockquote></p>
<h2>Modern Era</h2>
<p>Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and 
fiber connections. Computers now fit in our 
<small>pockets as smartphones</small>.
</p>
<h2>Computer Example</h2>
<p>To display text on a webpage, you can use:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>
&lt;head>
  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;<br>
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;<br>

&lt;/head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
  &lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
  &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
